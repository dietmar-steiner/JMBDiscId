This library is released under LGPL 2.1

The library depends on the following other Open Source Projects:

Apache Commons Logging 1.1.1  url: http://commons.apache.org/logging/
JNA 3.4.0 url: https://github.com/twall/jna
libdiscid url: http://musicbrainz.org/doc/libdiscid

I thank all of this people and organisations for having helped to make this project possible.

At the moment there is 1 problem as I only have a windows environment.
So I cannot test in either Unix nor OSX.
If anyone uses this software on an Unix or OSX system please let me know, so I can update 
the status of being tested on these systems.

On a further note libdiscid for windows is only available for 32 bit, so if anyone can 
generate me a 64bit dll of libdiscid, I could test it against that and we would have Windows 64bit. 

The distribution does not include the libdiscid library. Please download it from MusicBrainz.

For usage please look at examples.main.java
